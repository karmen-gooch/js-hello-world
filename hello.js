Next, PLAY! 
Modify your code on line 7 to try to accomplish the tasks listed below:

   1. Change the message that is printed.
   2. Figure out what the parentheses do. Will the code work without them? No it doesnt work the the parentheses 
   3. Remove one or both quotation marks. Do we need to include both opening and closing quote marks? Is there a difference between using a single or a double quote (' vs. ")?
   4. Remove the semi-colon, ;.
